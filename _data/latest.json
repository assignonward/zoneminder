  "body": "We've been saying the next release will be \"soon\" for some time now. The wait is over.\r\n\r\nThis minor release brings further improvements to native RTSP support when using a source type of \"remote\".  Newer h264 Foscam cameras should work now. We've made some inroads into getting Grandstream devices to work, but after fixing one issue we immediately ran into another, which has yet to be solved.  These devices, along with Trendnet and others, currently experience an RTCP Timeout after streaming video for 10 seconds.  We plan to have this fixed in a future release.\r\n\r\nThe folder location of zm.conf can now be specified at build time.\r\n\r\nInstead of patching the source code, package maintainers can now use the /ustils/zmeditconfigdata.sh tool to change any of the values found in the Config dB table prior to building.  For details on how to use this tool, execute the script from the command line, with no parameters, to display usage information.\r\n\r\nA much improved SELinux policy file has been included for CentOS 6. This file lives under /distros/redhat.  Users of zmrepo will automatically get this installed after a yum update to this version of zoneminder. Thanks go to Nate Dobbs for taking the time to do this work.\r\n\r\nThere are many other small, technical changes that can be viewed from the shortlog:\r\n\r\nIsaac Connor (38):\r\n      [66ff569] fix console refresh in this skin too\r\n      [1b0b774] add avdevice55 as a dependcy instead of 53, which we need for utopic\r\n      [6f4b158] remove annoying warning.\r\n      [2b4c06c] Add a stringVector join function for future use\r\n      [f019289] Include monitor name in log otput so we know which monitor we are talking about. This informaton is not included when the error occurs in zms.\r\n      [89b76ac] implement http_Digest Auth, and improve it for rtsp\r\n      [7efd0b9] merge the rest of my Digest-AUth fixes: This should solve #399\r\n      [e017e0f] add libgnutls28-dev as an option to libgnutls-dev add the other libjpeg*-dev options, any of which should do\r\n      [dd9493a] Merge pull request #596 from manupap1/debian_dep\r\n      [7369114] fix saving groups\r\n      [ca6f0bf] Don't use Data::Dumper unless you are actually using it for debugging.  No need to use ram. It is probably being included by one of the libraries anyways, but let's at least try to keep things as light as possible.\r\n      [03f28d4] more debug output when buffer is undersized.\r\n      [a6b880a] Merge pull request #575 from manupap1/memory_fix\r\n      [627f030] Merge pull request #574 from manupap1/rtsp_fix\r\n      [1fef262] Merge pull request #608 from knnniggett/RTSP_mUrl\r\n      [87b1d39] Merge pull request #607 from manupap1/memory_fix_leaks\r\n      [97c553f] Merge pull request #605 from manupap1/new_debian8_folder\r\n      [66cefd3] Merge pull request #582 from hanzese/patch-1\r\n      [e21d479] Merge pull request #615 from knnniggett/rtsp\r\n      [bdd929d] Merge pull request #567 from knnniggett/zm_config_dir\r\n      [8465803] Some cleanups, remove code that does nothing. Instead of using ControlDevice to store the password, parse the ControlAddress to get username, password enforce a port, which fixes the Digest Auth.\r\n      [fb28b86] default MoveRoot to empty to quiet an error in logs\r\n      [712df2a] alter the type of Device in the Monitors table to tinytext, which matches the MonitorPresets table, and increases the length to 255\r\n      [af4d413] fix auth requirement by checking for user when AUTH is on\r\n      [5f4e442] Merge pull request #636 from manupap1/debian_folder_fix\r\n      [a58c975] Merge pull request #634 from manupap1/debconf_support\r\n      [0ee2f7f] Merge pull request #640 from jrd288/offer_login\r\n      [f058861] update to what has been done in debian\r\n      [5326a1d] libjpeg updates to match debian\r\n      [5412817] this is in debian\r\n      [384e709] the debian packaging has this, and apparently we need it to build\r\n      [a0214fb] fix a bare ZM_PATH_BIN which should be $Config{ZM_PATH_BIN}\r\n      [0738fd5] this add some quoting, it's something debian and ubuntu packaging does, but it's pretty clear that it is good in a more general sense.\r\n      [1723aa9] bump version number to 1.28.1\r\n      [a16daba] already applied\r\n      [e68d3c6] fix merge conflict\r\n      [464e7ea] Merge pull request #660 from SteveGilvarry/patch-3\r\n      [9313280] Merge pull request #665 from knnniggett/rtp_ctrl\r\n\r\nAndrew Bauer (20):\r\n      [54b1919] Update skin.js\r\n      [c6f610e] Merge pull request #584 from ZoneMinder/zmupdatefixes\r\n      [c2dbd57] Update zm.in\r\n      [b3be653] Merge pull request #594 from ndobbs/feature-ndobbs_selinux_rhel6_support\r\n      [a76c867] Merge pull request #588 from ZoneMinder/digest_auth\r\n      [0e3fb36] Merge pull request #621 from manupap1/new_debian8_folder\r\n      [de11064] Output to stderror when zmu can't read zm.conf\r\n      [4866339] Merge pull request #631 from ZoneMinder/fix_security_on_watch\r\n      [f2bb36c] Merge pull request #635 from ZoneMinder/zmcontrol_improvements\r\n      [eb60468] Merge pull request #632 from ZoneMinder/better_security\r\n      [04cd580] Merge pull request #647 from ariscop/master\r\n      [1f42ce1] Merge pull request #657 from ZoneMinder/log_export_use_PATH_SWAP\r\n      [c26ca7f] Move script to /utils\r\n      [2d5e868] Update zoneminder.cmake.el6.spec\r\n      [56d5e14] Rename zoneminder.cmake.el6.spec to zoneminder.el6.spec\r\n      [9bec156] bump version to 1.28.1 for autotools\r\n      [16267ce] Update rpm specfiles to make use of zmeditconfigdata.sh\r\n      [dc01981] Update zoneminder.cmake.f20.spec\r\n      [70b69d3] Update zoneminder.cmake.f20.spec\r\n      [898b0fd] Rename zoneminder.cmake.f20.spec to zoneminder.f20.spec\r\n\r\nSune1337 (7):\r\n      [9b935fd] - Timeout when opening stream after 10 seconds Sometimes when restarting the camera ffmpeg hung itself in some state, when calling avformat_open_input, which seemed to last forever. - Reopen stream if av_read_frame returns EOF Sometimes ffmpeg starts returning an EOF error when calling av_read_frame. Once this happens it seems no more images will ever be captured. - Reopen stream if av_read_frame returns -110 Means something like Connection failed; cant remember. Anyway. Once this happens it seems no more images will ever be captured.\r\n      [c15e713] Use value from options (FFMPEG_OPEN_TIMEOUT) as timeout when calling av_open_input_file.\r\n      [bfcf378] removed use of av_err2str. someone could not compile when using that macro.\r\n      [a803d85] Process should exit if ReopenFfmpeg function fails to create a worker thread.\r\n      [ce7fe85] Define AV_ERROR_MAX_STRING_SIZE to 64 if it is not already defined.\r\n      [0fa8bd5] Define AV_ERROR_MAX_STRING_SIZE after all include files to use ffmpeg define if it exists.\r\n      [b07ca21] - join reconnect thread when finished to clean up thread resources. - don't spawn a new thread for every attempt to open a stream while reconnecting.\r\n\r\nKyle Johnson (2):\r\n      [af2d893] Merge pull request #591 from SteveGilvarry/docs-updates\r\n      [b024f9c] Merge pull request #606 from manupap1/memory_fix_mismatches\r\n\r\nSteveGilvarry (2):\r\n      [d3d2741] Put opts back in\r\n      [fb8a36c] Updating Options documentation\r\n\r\nEmmanuel Papin (1):\r\n      [0da17db] Convert french lang file to UTF-8\r\n\r\nhanzese (1):\r\n      [1d7e6f2] Update et_ee.php\r\n\r\nmanupap1 (1):\r\n      [811ec82] Fixed bug in rtsp streaming caused by a signed - unsigned conversion.\r\n"
