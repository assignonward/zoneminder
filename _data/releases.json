    "body": "We've been saying the next release will be \"soon\" for some time now. The wait is over.\r\n\r\nThis minor release brings further improvements to native RTSP support when using a source type of \"remote\".  Newer h264 Foscam cameras should work now. We've made some inroads into getting Grandstream devices to work, but after fixing one issue we immediately ran into another, which has yet to be solved.  These devices, along with Trendnet and others, currently experience an RTCP Timeout after streaming video for 10 seconds.  We plan to have this fixed in a future release.\r\n\r\nThe folder location of zm.conf can now be specified at build time.\r\n\r\nInstead of patching the source code, package maintainers can now use the /ustils/zmeditconfigdata.sh tool to change any of the values found in the Config dB table prior to building.  For details on how to use this tool, execute the script from the command line, with no parameters, to display usage information.\r\n\r\nA much improved SELinux policy file has been included for CentOS 6. This file lives under /distros/redhat.  Users of zmrepo will automatically get this installed after a yum update to this version of zoneminder. Thanks go to Nate Dobbs for taking the time to do this work.\r\n\r\nThere are many other small, technical changes that can be viewed from the shortlog:\r\n\r\nIsaac Connor (38):\r\n      [66ff569] fix console refresh in this skin too\r\n      [1b0b774] add avdevice55 as a dependcy instead of 53, which we need for utopic\r\n      [6f4b158] remove annoying warning.\r\n      [2b4c06c] Add a stringVector join function for future use\r\n      [f019289] Include monitor name in log otput so we know which monitor we are talking about.

    "body": "# Release 1.28.0 - Ride the Lightning\r\nThis is the first release of ZoneMinder to officially support the newer php found in Ubuntu 14.04.  Since Ubuntu 14.10 is right around the corner, preliminary tests indicate ZoneMinder 1.28.0 works with that as well.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ubuntu 14.10, this version of Ubuntu will include the infamous systemd.  This replaces the old sysv init system and will require a learning curve for those who have not yet been exposed to it.  Nearly all the major Linux distros have migrated to systemd.  Why am I mentioning this in the ZoneMinder release notes?  Because we have recently added full support for systemd.  For details, read #502.\r\n\r\nZoneMinder now requires the polkit package and the URI::Encode perl module.\r\n\r\nBe advised that certain default folders have changed.  ZM_TMPDIR now defaults to /var/tmp and ZM_SOCKDIR now defaults to /var/run.  Be advised that ZoneMinder will *not* change these values on an existing database.  For further details, read #524.\r\n\r\nWe've fixed an old \"shared data size conflict\" error that some users on certain 32bit distros experienced when running on hardware that was 64bit capable.  For details, see #462. \r\n\r\nI've probably forgotten to mention something so here is the shortlog.\r\n\r\nIsaac Connor (121):\r\n      [9e2d7cf] initial convert to PDO with no testing\r\n      [5eb313b] add config lline for DB type\r\n      [cd63b0a] add defaults for ZM_DB_TYPE\r\n      [b126c5a] fix typo\r\n      [36c4fad] remove extra quoets since dbEcape does quoting now\r\n      [0979830] more removal of exra quotes\r\n      [2a45506] more quoting removal\r\n      [09fbdc9] forget the updates to this file\r\n      [60e2703] fix missing n\r\n      [92591a6] more removal of quotes\r\n      [cde89a7] more quoting removal, some slight optimisations\r\n      [7fdb933] rework dbQuery, dbFetchOne to take a parameters array, and use it\r\n      [ae51ac5] redo changes to use new dbFetch functions with parameter arrays\r\n      [9356065] make sortorder be asc or desc, not something arbitrary which needs to be escaped other fixes to use parameter passing to PDO instead of escaping them ourselves\r\n      [59b8419] use parameter passing instead of explicit exscaping\r\n      [2d0f4df] Fix a missing NULL second paramter to dbFetchAll\r\n      [51455b5] more updates and removal of escaping and quoting\r\n      [4c6c415] fix: wrote dbCon instead of dbConn\r\n      [03809cf] improve error reporting\r\n      [a0c7b8d] add rules to build a dbg package\r\n      [a155082] use parameter passing instead of esacping\r\n      [9699187] more updates, currently the log updates are not enough.

    "body": "# Release 1.27.0 - Battery\r\nThis is an exciting release as we are fixing a number of bugs, as well as releasing a few new features.  Notable notables include:\r\n\r\n## A new skin!\r\nThis is the initial release of the 'flat' skin, courteously of Justin Lawrence (@justinlawrence).  If you'd like to give it a try, you can do so by changing the ZM_SKIN variable in the options menu, or by appending ?skin=flat to your URL.  Please report any bugs with this skin if you choose to use it.\r\n\r\n## zmcamtool.pl\r\nPreviously, there was no easy way to bring in new ptz controls and camera presets into an existing ZoneMinder system. For the non-technical, programming the same camera into a different system usually meant typing everything in by hand again. This new tool makes it possible to import and export these settings to or from a sql file. You can also use this tool to import any new controls or presets into your existing database, which were added to a new version of ZoneMinder. Execute \"zmcamtool.pl --help\" from the command line for further details.\r\n\r\n## Docker\r\nThis release contains an inital ZoneMinder Dockerfile.  Docker, and Dockerfiles, allow you to spin up disposable 'containers', which are essentially self-contained linux virtual machines, each with a specific purpose (such as running ZoneMinder).  This feature is an attempt to speed up testing of features and bugs.  \r\n\r\nThis is still in early stages, however more information can be [found here](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/wiki/Docker).\r\n\r\n## A new camera source type, libvlc.\r\nCourtesy of @ebarnard! Yes, you can probably guess what this means.  If the optional libvlc libraries are installed on your system, ZoneMinder will theoretically be able to stream from any camera the popular VLC media player can stream from. If you own an IP camera that previous versions of ZoneMinder did not support then try this new method.  More information is [here](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/wiki/libvlc-source-type).\r\n"
